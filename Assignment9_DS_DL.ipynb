The generator generates synthetic samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated samples. Through adversarial training, the generator improves its ability to fool the discriminator, leading to the generation of realistic samples. GANs find a balance where the generator produces high-quality samples, and the discriminator cannot differentiate between real and generated samples.
